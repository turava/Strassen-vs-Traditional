# Strassen-vs-Traditional
## Matrix Multiplication: Traditional vs. Strassen
This project explores and compares the performance of two algorithms for matrix multiplication: the traditional method and Strassen's algorithm. Implemented in MATLAB, it benchmarks both methods across various matrix sizes, analyzes their efficiency, and presents the results through clear visualizations and tables. The goal is to understand their computational trade-offs and identify scenarios where each algorithm excels.

## Key Features
- Implementation of the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm.
- Implementation of Strassen's recursive matrix multiplication algorithm.
- Benchmarking and comparison of execution times for matrices of different sizes.
- Results presented via detailed tables and graphs.
- Discussion on computational overhead and optimization challenges.

## Usage
This repository is ideal for:
- Students studying computational mathematics.
- Researchers analyzing matrix multiplication performance.
- Developers interested in algorithm optimization or numerical computing.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested with R2023a or later)
- Basic understanding of matrix operations and algorithms.
